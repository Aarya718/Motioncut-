# Project 4 - Virtual coin toss

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Python program that simulates a virtual coin toss, allowing users to flip a coin and get a random outcome of either "Heads" or "Tails."

Overview

- The Virtual Coin Toss is a Python-based program that randomly generates a coin toss outcome.

- The program allows users to flip the coin multiple times and keeps track of the results.

- It provides a count of the number of heads and tails obtained over multiple flips.

- Users can choose to continue flipping or exit the program.

- Additionally, an enhancement can include a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
