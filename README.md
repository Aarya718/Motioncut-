Name: Aarya Ramchandra Tarphe

Batch: 5th February 2025

Duration: 3months

# Project 1 - Random Username Generator

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a Python program that generates unique and fun usernames suitable for social media or gaming platforms.

Overview

- The Random Username Generator is a Python-based program that generates unique usernames using a combination of adjectives and nouns.
  
- The program allows users to customize usernames by adding numbers, special characters, and setting a maximum length.
  
- Additionally, it provides an option to save the generated usernames to a text file.

# Project 2 - Word Counter

 Objective: The goal of this project is to create a simple Python program that counts the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph.

 Overview

- The Word Counter is a Python-based program that allows users to enter text and calculates the total number of words present in the input.
  
- The program ensures valid input and provides an easy-to-use interface.

- The program provides error handling for empty input and ensures accurate word count.
  
- Additionally, future enhancements can include counting occurrences of each word and processing text files for word count analysis.

# Project 3 - Expense Tracker

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a Python-based application that helps users track and manage their expenses by inputting details such as the amount, category, and description of each expense.

Overview

- The Expense Tracker is a Python-based program that allows users to enter and manage their expenses, storing them in a CSV file for easy access and future reference.

- The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can input details of their expenses, such as the amount, category, and description, and view their recorded expenses in a table format.

- The program ensures valid input for the expense amount, providing error handling for invalid inputs and displaying appropriate messages to users.

- Additionally, future enhancements can include generating detailed expense reports, setting a monthly budget tracker with alerts, and allowing users to import/export data from other formats.

# Project 4 - Virtual coin toss

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Python program that simulates a virtual coin toss, allowing users to flip a coin and get a random outcome of either "Heads" or "Tails."

Overview

- The Virtual Coin Toss is a Python-based program that randomly generates a coin toss outcome.

- The program allows users to flip the coin multiple times and keeps track of the results.

- It provides a count of the number of heads and tails obtained over multiple flips.

- Users can choose to continue flipping or exit the program.

# Project 5 - Text Reverser

Objective:
The goal of this project is to create a Python program that reverses user-input text either by reversing the character order or the word order. 
This project enhances string manipulation skills and strengthens user interaction handling in Python.

Overview:

- The Text Reverser is a Python-based program that allows users to reverse a given sentence either by character order or word order.

- The program features an interactive menu, enabling users to choose between different reversal methods while ensuring a smooth user experience.

- It includes error handling to prevent crashes due to empty inputs and provides an option to save the reversed text into a file for future reference.
