# Project 3 - Expense Tracker

Objective: The goal of this project is to create a Python-based application that helps users track and manage their expenses by inputting details such as the amount, category, and description of each expense.

Overview

- The Expense Tracker is a Python-based program that allows users to enter and manage their expenses, storing them in a CSV file for easy access and future reference.
  
- The program provides a user-friendly interface where users can input details of their expenses, such as the amount, category, and description, and view their recorded expenses in a table format.

- The program ensures valid input for the expense amount, providing error handling for invalid inputs and displaying appropriate messages to users.

- Additionally, future enhancements can include generating detailed expense reports, setting a monthly budget tracker with alerts, and allowing users to import/export data from other formats.
